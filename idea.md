# 🚀 DevTrack – Career Operating System for Developers

## 📌 Overview

DevTrack is a web-based career execution platform built specifically for aspiring software engineers.

Unlike generic habit trackers, DevTrack connects daily coding efforts, internship applications, and project milestones to measurable career growth using analytics and proof-based tracking.

It transforms random productivity into structured career execution.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Computer science students and aspiring developers struggle with:

- Inconsistent coding practice
- Lack of measurable skill growth
- Random internship applications without tracking
- No visibility into career readiness
- Generic habit apps that don't connect actions to outcomes

There is no unified system that connects:

Daily Coding → Skill Growth → Internship Readiness → Career Score

---

## 👥 Target Users

- Computer Science students
- Internship seekers
- Self-taught developers
- Bootcamp learners
- Freelancers building technical skills

---

## 💡 Core Concept

DevTrack is not a habit tracker.

It is a **Career Operating System**.

It combines:

- Proof-based coding tracking (GitHub sync)
- Internship application CRM
- Skill investment analytics
- Career readiness scoring
- Focus session tracking

---

## 🏆 Key Differentiator

Most habit apps rely on manual checkboxes.

DevTrack integrates:

- GitHub commit tracking
- Coding streak detection
- Internship pipeline analytics
- Career readiness scoring

It tracks execution, not motivation.

---

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)

### 1️⃣ Coding Habit Tracking
- Create coding habits (e.g., “Solve 2 DSA problems daily”)
- GitHub commit sync
- Streak tracking
- Contribution heatmap
- Manual logging fallback

---

### 2️⃣ Internship Funnel Tracker
Track internship/job applications with pipeline stages:

- Applied
- Online Assessment
- Interview
- Rejected
- Offer

Includes:
- Conversion rate analytics
- Timeline tracking
- Application count insights

---

### 3️⃣ Career Score Engine
A dynamic score (0–100) calculated using:

- Coding consistency
- Project activity
- Internship applications
- Focus time logged

Displays:
- Weekly progress trend
- Skill improvement graph

---

### 4️⃣ Focus Mode
- 25-minute Pomodoro timer
- Session logging
- Habit attachment
- Reflection notes

---

## 🧠 Technical Stack

Frontend:
- React.js
- Recharts / Chart.js
- Context API / Zustand

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT Authentication
- GitHub API integration

---

## 🏗 Architecture Approach

OOP principles applied on backend:

- Abstract base class: `TrackableEntity`
- Inheritance: `Habit`, `Project`, `InternshipTracker`
- Encapsulation: CareerScoreEngine logic separated from controllers
- Polymorphism: Different scoring behaviors per activity type

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

- 30+ day coding streak retention
- GitHub integration rate
- Internship funnel usage
- Weekly active users
- Career score improvement trend

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- LeetCode API sync
- Resume PDF auto-generation
- LinkedIn progress cards
- Skill radar visualization
- AI growth suggestions
- College leaderboard mode

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

DevTrack demonstrates:

- Real-world API integration
- Analytics engine design
- Full-stack architecture
- Clean OOP backend structure
- Product thinking beyond CRUD apps

It positions itself as:

> A data-driven Career Execution System for aspiring software engineers.

## 📌 Vision

To help developers turn daily effort into measurable career growth.

Execution over motivation.
Proof over promises.
Systems over randomness.
